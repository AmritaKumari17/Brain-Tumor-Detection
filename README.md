# Brain Tumor Detection

## Overview
Brain tumor detection is a critical task in medical imaging that helps in early diagnosis and treatment planning. This project implements different image transformation methods to improve the accuracy of brain tumor detection from medical images such as MRI scans.

## Features
- Utilizes various image transformation techniques.
- Enhances the contrast and features of MRI scans.
- Applies machine learning or deep learning for classification.
- Provides visualizations for better understanding.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Torch
- Pandas

## Image Processing Techniques

The image processing pipeline for ViTs and Swin Transformers involves several key steps:

1.Preprocessing:

-Convert images to grayscale or RGB format as required.

-Resize images to a fixed dimension (e.g., 256×256) to ensure consistency.

-Normalize pixel values to a standard range (e.g., [0,1] or [-1,1]).

2.Patch Extraction:

-Divide images into non-overlapping patches (e.g., 16×16 pixels per patch).

-Flatten each patch into a 1D vector representation.

3.Feature Encoding:

-Apply positional encoding to preserve spatial relationships.

-Utilize self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies.

4.Training and Inference:

-Train models using large-scale image datasets (e.g., ImageNet, medical imaging datasets).

-Perform fine-tuning on domain-specific datasets for better accuracy.

-Implement data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, flipping, contrast adjustments) to enhance model generalization.

5.Post-processing:

-Apply thresholding techniques for classification tasks.

-Use segmentation masks for object detection and medical imaging applications.


## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   (https://github.com/AmritaKumari17/Brain-Tumor-Detection)
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the preprocessing script:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```
2. Apply transformations and visualize:
   ```bash
   python transform.py
   ```
3. Train the model (if using machine learning/deep learning):
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

## Dataset
You can use publicly available MRI datasets such as:
- [Kaggle Brain Tumor Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [Medical Image Databases](https://www.medicalimagingdatasets.com)

## Results
- The model/classifier will output whether a brain tumor is detected or not.
- Visual outputs of transformed images to aid in analysis.

## Future Improvements
- Implement deep learning models for improved accuracy.
- Add a web-based UI for easy access to the detection system.
- Improve segmentation techniques for better tumor localization.
